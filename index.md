# **Design, Fabrication and Control of the Flapping Wing Robot 'Beagle-Flap'**
Towards building a flapping wing aerial robot with Linux-based AutoPilot, Using Beagle as a flight controller.

---

Beagle-Flap project aims to use a Linux-based autopilot for bio-inspired flapping wing robot's using the Beagle and a custom cape as hardware blueprints and [DroneForce](https://dfautopilot.com/), a framework to ship custom controller (offboard) with Ardupilot as the software one to allow experimentation and development of control and navigation algorithms.

You can reproduce Beagle-Flap robot from scratch the whole design is built to be manufactured cheaply and quickly with standard 3D printing and a 2D plate cutter and buying a few standard mechanical parts together with some off-the-shelf electronic circuits together and a BeagleBone Black, BBBmini. With a few steps you compile ArduPilot, and flash it to the Beagle and fly, crash and fly again.
